# English to Te Reo Maori Translator
This repository contains a simple command line application that translates simple English sentences to the Māori language. The sentences to be translated must consist of a subject (pronoun) and a verb. The tool can understand singular and plural forms and different tenses.

## Overview
This translation program works by breaking down an English sentence into its subject and verb. It then tries to translate the subject (a pronoun) and the verb into Māori using pre-specified dictionaries. The program also recognizes different tenses and adjusts the Māori sentence structure accordingly.

## How to Use
Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the main.py Python script.
You can then input English sentences one line at a time. The program will print the translated Māori sentence.

## Limitations
This translator has some important limitations:

It can only translate sentences consisting of a subject and a verb.
It recognizes a limited set of pronouns and verbs.
It can only handle present and simple past tenses.
It does not handle complex sentence structures or other parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, etc.)
It assumes that all pronouns are in lower case.
Despite these limitations, this simple translator can be a useful tool for learning basic Māori sentence structures.
